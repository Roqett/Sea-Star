# Progress

Live build state and session handoff. Read this before starting work; append a handoff
note at the end of every session.

## Current state

- **Version:** 0.1.0 (unreleased). Repo is **private** until built and tested.
- **Health:** `uv run ruff check .` clean; `uv run pytest` — 27 passing.
- **Bridge:** `sea-star doctor --json` now exists (the machine-readable contract the app
  polls). `include` / `exclude` tool curation is wired through `config.py` →
  `mcp_client.py`.
- **Naming:** repo is **`Roqett/Sea-Star`** (personal — keeps the history on the founder's
  profile). "Up Periscope" is the **product identity** (licence + bundle id), not a GitHub
  org. Codeberg remote is `Touretro/theSeaStar`.
- **Runtime on this machine:** Osaurus running on `http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1`, model
  `foundation` (Apple on-device, zero downloads, macOS 26+). `sea-star doctor` prints
  **Ready**.
- **Vault:** autodetected from Obsidian; a throwaway `demo-vault/` is used for testing.

## What exists

| Area | File | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI | `src/sea_star/cli.py` | Done — `version`, `init`, `doctor` (incl. `--json`), `ask`, `serve`. |
| Config + autodetect | `src/sea_star/config.py` | Done — runtime probe, `obsidian.json` vault detect, `include`/`exclude` (`allows()`). |
| Inference | `src/sea_star/inference.py` | Done — OpenAI-compatible over raw `httpx`. |
| Vault | `src/sea_star/vault.py` | Done — scan, search, read, write, append, citations. |
| Tools | `src/sea_star/tools.py` | Done — registry + 4 built-in vault tools. |
| Agent loop | `src/sea_star/agent.py` | Done — bounded loop, citations, fail-loud. |
| MCP server | `src/sea_star/mcp_server.py` | Done — exposes `ask_seastar`, `vault_*`. |
| MCP client | `src/sea_star/mcp_client.py` | Done — bridges external servers, namespaced, curated by `include`/`exclude`. |
| Docs | `docs/` | **Added this session** — tiered: start-here → connect → reference → troubleshooting. |

## File ownership

No parallel agents active. Single-writer.

## Handoff — previous session

**Completed**

- Built the `docs/` folder: a docs index, a zero-jargon `start-here.md`, the
  `connect.md` guide (the previously missing "how do I wire Sea-Star into Osaurus / Claude
  Desktop / Cursor / TRAE" instructions, plus what to say to the agents), a technical
  `reference.md`, and `troubleshooting.md`.
- Wired the repository `README.md` to the docs index with a Documentation section.
- Confirmed live state: repo `Roqett/Sea-Star` on `main`, v0.1.0, Osaurus on 1337,
  `doctor` Ready.

**Half-finished / open**

- Nothing in the code. Docs are written but not yet reviewed by the founder.
- Roadmap items still open: semantic (embedding) recall, `.mcpb` one-click Desktop
  Extension, a local-model/MCP conformance table.

**Single next step**

- Founder reviews the new `docs/` pages. If approved, this is a natural point to flip the
  repository from private to public.

## Handoff — 2026-09-25

**Completed**

- Shipped the **app bridge contract**: `sea-star doctor --json` always returns one JSON
  object (vault, notes, runtime, base_url, model, models, bridged servers), even on failure.
- Added **`include` / `exclude`** tool curation to `[[mcp.servers]]`, applied at connect
  time in `mcp_client.list_external_tools` so the agent sees a short tool menu.
- Rewrote `README.md` as **two equal tracks** (terminal-first now, GUI-first coming) with a
  parity table; removed the marketing pull-quote and the `## The name` section.
- Took the mac-app spec to **Revision 2**: dual-track model (D9), identity/naming (D10),
  corrected Xcode toolchain + native `xcrun mcpbridge` path (§9.1), Omarchy port (§3).
- Added `docs/README_DRY.md` — a spin-free reference doc for cross-checking the Omarchy
  port with other models.

**Half-finished / open**

- **Naming resolved — stays personal.** The repo stays at `Roqett/Sea-Star` so the history
  shows on the founder's profile. Notarisation and the bundle id depend on the **Apple
  Developer account, not GitHub**, so no org is needed. All links were repointed from
  `UpPeriscope/Sea-Star` back to `Roqett/Sea-Star`.
- **Spec set is now tracked.** `.trae/specs/mac-app/` (`spec.md`, `tasks.md`,
  `checklist.md`) is committed; `.trae/*` is gitignored except `specs/`.
- Bridge tests for `--json` and `allows()` (spec T1.5/T1.6/T1.8) not yet written.

**Single next step**

- Founder reviews the rewritten `README.md` + the spec Revision 2, then the repo can go
  public (naming settled: stays at `Roqett/Sea-Star`).
