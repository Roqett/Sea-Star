# Progress

Live build state and session handoff. Read this before starting work; append a handoff
note at the end of every session.

## Current state

- **Version:** 0.1.0 (unreleased). Repo is **private** until built and tested.
- **Health:** `uv run ruff check .` clean; `uv run pytest` — 51 passing. App:
  `xcodebuild … test` — 12 Swift Testing cases passing (4 suites).
- **Bridge:** `sea-star doctor --json` now emits the full §6 contract —
  `schema_version`, nested `vault {path, source, note_count, candidates}`, `server.state`,
  and `runtimes[]` (one object per live harness). Always one JSON object, even on failure.
  `include` / `exclude` tool curation is wired through `config.py` → `mcp_client.py`.
- **Cockpit (new):** the macOS menu-bar app exists under `macapp/` (XcodeGen + SwiftUI).
  It builds, launches, and its 12 Swift Testing cases pass. Popover shows vault/harness/model
  and its vault, model and harness rows are pick-lists (T3.2/T3.3 + multi-harness), switching
  via `SEASTAR_VAULT` / `SEASTAR_MODEL` / `SEASTAR_BASE_URL`+`SEASTAR_RUNTIME`. It holds **all four founder icons in one roster** (`IconRoster`) and
  rerolls to a different face on server start/stop — the "open and shut" Easter egg (T4.7) —
  shown on both the menu-bar glyph and the popover header. Faces now wear the founder's
  **real art** (T4.3/T4.4 cuts): `Face*MenuBar` solid silhouettes for the menu bar,
  `Face*Header` full-detail cuts for the header, both template-tinted. The header face carries
  a caustic shimmer (T4.5) via `Shaders/Caustics.metal`.
- **Naming:** repo is **`Roqett/Sea-Star`** (personal — keeps the history on the founder's
  profile). "Up Periscope" is the **product identity** (licence + bundle id), not a GitHub
  org. Codeberg remote is `Touretro/theSeaStar`.
- **Runtime on this machine:** Osaurus running on `http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1`, model
  `foundation` (Apple on-device, zero downloads, macOS 26+). `sea-star doctor` prints
  **Ready**.
- **Vault:** autodetected from Obsidian; a throwaway `demo-vault/` is used for testing.

## What exists

| Area | File | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI | `src/sea_star/cli.py` | Done — `version`, `init`, `doctor` (incl. `--json`), `ask`, `serve`. |
| Config + autodetect | `src/sea_star/config.py` | Done — runtime probe, `obsidian.json` vault detect, `include`/`exclude` (`allows()`). |
| Inference | `src/sea_star/inference.py` | Done — OpenAI-compatible over raw `httpx`. |
| Vault | `src/sea_star/vault.py` | Done — scan, search, read, write, append, citations. |
| Tools | `src/sea_star/tools.py` | Done — registry + 4 built-in vault tools. |
| Agent loop | `src/sea_star/agent.py` | Done — bounded loop, citations, fail-loud. |
| MCP server | `src/sea_star/mcp_server.py` | Done — exposes `ask_seastar`, `vault_*`. |
| MCP client | `src/sea_star/mcp_client.py` | Done — bridges external servers, namespaced, curated by `include`/`exclude`. |
| Docs | `docs/` | **Added this session** — tiered: start-here → connect → reference → troubleshooting. |
| Cockpit (mac app) | `macapp/` | **New** — XcodeGen project + SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra`. `App/ Views/ Models/ Services/ Support/ Shaders/`; builds, launches, 11 Swift tests pass. Vault + model pick-lists (T3.2/T3.3) wired to `SEASTAR_VAULT`/`SEASTAR_MODEL`. Four-face icon roster rerolls on start/stop (T4.7), now wearing the real T4.3/T4.4 cuts; header caustic shimmer (T4.5). |

## File ownership

No parallel agents active. Single-writer.

## Handoff — previous session

**Completed**

- Built the `docs/` folder: a docs index, a zero-jargon `start-here.md`, the
  `connect.md` guide (the previously missing "how do I wire Sea-Star into Osaurus / Claude
  Desktop / Cursor / TRAE" instructions, plus what to say to the agents), a technical
  `reference.md`, and `troubleshooting.md`.
- Wired the repository `README.md` to the docs index with a Documentation section.
- Confirmed live state: repo `Roqett/Sea-Star` on `main`, v0.1.0, Osaurus on 1337,
  `doctor` Ready.

**Half-finished / open**

- Nothing in the code. Docs are written but not yet reviewed by the founder.
- Roadmap items still open: semantic (embedding) recall, `.mcpb` one-click Desktop
  Extension, a local-model/MCP conformance table.

**Single next step**

- Founder reviews the new `docs/` pages. If approved, this is a natural point to flip the
  repository from private to public.

## Handoff — 2026-09-25

**Completed**

- Shipped the **app bridge contract**: `sea-star doctor --json` always returns one JSON
  object (vault, notes, runtime, base_url, model, models, bridged servers), even on failure.
- Added **`include` / `exclude`** tool curation to `[[mcp.servers]]`, applied at connect
  time in `mcp_client.list_external_tools` so the agent sees a short tool menu.
- Rewrote `README.md` as **two equal tracks** (terminal-first now, GUI-first coming) with a
  parity table; removed the marketing pull-quote and the `## The name` section.
- Took the mac-app spec to **Revision 2**: dual-track model (D9), identity/naming (D10),
  corrected Xcode toolchain + native `xcrun mcpbridge` path (§9.1), Omarchy port (§3).
- Added `docs/README_DRY.md` — a spin-free reference doc for cross-checking the Omarchy
  port with other models.

**Half-finished / open**

- **Naming resolved — stays personal.** The repo stays at `Roqett/Sea-Star` so the history
  shows on the founder's profile. Notarisation and the bundle id depend on the **Apple
  Developer account, not GitHub**, so no org is needed. All links were repointed from
  `UpPeriscope/Sea-Star` back to `Roqett/Sea-Star`.
- **Spec set is now tracked.** `.trae/specs/mac-app/` (`spec.md`, `tasks.md`,
  `checklist.md`) is committed; `.trae/*` is gitignored except `specs/`.
- Bridge tests for `--json` and `allows()` (spec T1.5/T1.6/T1.8) not yet written.

**Single next step**

- Founder reviews the rewritten `README.md` + the spec Revision 2, then the repo can go
  public (naming settled: stays at `Roqett/Sea-Star`).

## Handoff — 2026-09-25 (cockpit scaffold)

**Completed**

- **Bridge finished to the §6 contract.** `doctor --json` now emits `schema_version`, a
  nested `vault {path, source, note_count, candidates}` object, and `server.state`; still
  one JSON object always, human output still default. New vault helpers in `config.py`:
  `detect_vault_candidates()` (open-first, then most-recent) and `resolve_vault()` →
  `(path, source)` with `source` ∈ `env`/`toml`/`obsidian`, failing loud.
- **Tests added:** `tests/test_cli.py` (bridge shape, fail-loud one object, human default)
  and additions to `tests/test_config.py` (vault candidates/resolution, `allows()`).
  Engine: `uv run ruff check .` clean, `uv run pytest` → **40 passing**.
- **macOS menu-bar app scaffolded** under `macapp/`: XcodeGen `project.yml`, SwiftUI
  `MenuBarExtra` with `.menuBarExtraStyle(.window)`, files split by responsibility.
  `EngineClient` runs `sea-star doctor --json` and decodes it; `ServerController` owns
  refresh + start/stop of `sea-star serve`; popover renders vault/harness/model with the
  Carpet Sea Star palette and glass controls. Bundle id `UpPeriscope.Sea-Star`, target
  macOS 26.0. Builds, launches, **4 Swift Testing cases pass**.
- **Verified:** `xcodegen generate` → `xcodebuild ... build` → `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`;
  `xcodebuild ... test` → `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`; app launches without crashing.

**Half-finished / open**

- Menu-bar icon is a **placeholder SF Symbol** (`Strings.MenuBar.systemImage`); the
  founder is producing the real monochrome template image (spec T4.3/T4.4).
- Popover shows the detected vault/harness/model, but the **vault pick-list (T3.2)** and
  **model pick-list (T3.3)** are not built yet — the bridge already carries
  `vault.candidates`, so those can read straight from the report.
- Start/stop spawns `sea-star serve` and terminates it; it does not yet watch the child's
  exit, so state can go stale if the process dies on its own.
- Graph embedding (T4.2), re-index (T4.1), and both operator instruction docs (T6.x) are
  untouched.

**Single next step**

- Build the vault pick-list (T3.2): a menu in the popover listing `report.vault.candidates`,
  with the current vault checked, switching by re-running the engine with `SEASTAR_VAULT`.

## Handoff — 2026-09-25 (cockpit pick-lists)

**Completed**

- **Vault pick-list (T3.2) and model pick-list (T3.3).** The popover's vault and model rows
  are now menus: the vault menu lists `report.vault.candidates` (the current vault is always
  included, even when it came from env/TOML), the model menu lists `report.models`. The
  current choice shows in-row, is checked in the menu, and the control disables itself when
  there is nothing to switch to. New `PickerRow` (plus a shared `AccentBar`) in
  `CockpitPopoverView`.
- **Switching needs no engine change.** `EngineCommand.Invocation` now carries an
  `environment` map (`EngineCommand.vaultOverrideKey`/`modelOverrideKey` = `SEASTAR_VAULT` /
  `SEASTAR_MODEL`), merged over the inherited environment in `ProcessRunner` and in
  `ServerController.startServer`. Changing a choice re-runs `doctor --json` with the pin, and
  **restarts a running server** so the new vault/model takes effect.
- **Tests:** new Swift Testing cases for the env threading and the empty-engine case —
  `xcodebuild … test` → **7 tests in 3 suites passing**; `… build` → **BUILD SUCCEEDED**;
  app launches without crashing.

**Half-finished / open**

- Start/stop still does not watch the child's exit (state can go stale if `serve` dies);
  worth addressing alongside T4.
- Menu-bar icon is still the placeholder SF Symbol (founder is producing the real template
  image — T4.3/T4.4). Graph embedding (T4.2), re-index (T4.1) and operator docs (T6.x) are
  untouched.

**Single next step**

- Phase 4 polish: re-index codebase-memory (T4.1) and embed the graph UI via `WKWebView` →
  `http://localhost:9749`, restyled to the palette (T4.2).

## Handoff — 2026-09-25 (icon Easter egg)

**Completed**

- **The "open and shut" Easter egg (T4.7).** All four of the founder's icons are held in one
  roster, `Support/IconRoster.swift` (`AppIcon` + `IconRoster.all` + a never-repeat
  `next(after:)`). The app wears one face at a time and rerolls to a **different** face every
  time the server starts or stops — never the one that just went away. The face shows on both
  surfaces: the menu-bar glyph and the popover header, and each face carries its own glow
  colour so the swap is unmistakable.
- **Plumbing.** `ServerController` owns `currentIcon` and advances it on genuine start/stop
  transitions (and on a vault/model switch, which restarts). The controller is hoisted into
  `SeaStarApp` so the `MenuBarExtra` glyph is state-driven (was a fixed `systemImage`), and
  the popover reads the same instance. New `Views/AppIconMark.swift` renders a face on either
  surface — exported artwork when present, placeholder symbol otherwise, template rendering
  for the menu bar.
- **Tests:** `IconRoster` (four distinct faces; a reroll never repeats the current face; a
  reroll with nothing showing still returns a face) plus the cockpit's opening face —
  `xcodebuild … test` → **11 tests in 4 suites passing**; `… build` → **BUILD SUCCEEDED**;
  app launches without crashing.

**Half-finished / open**

- Faces are **placeholder SF Symbols**. When the Icon Composer art lands, export the PNGs to
  `Assets.xcassets` and set `headerAsset`/`menuBarAsset` on each `IconRoster.all` entry —
  no view or controller change needed (spec T4.3/T4.4).
- Start/stop still does not watch the child's exit (state can go stale if `serve` dies).
- Graph embedding (T4.2), re-index (T4.1) and operator docs (T6.x) are untouched.
- Work is staged on `feat/macapp-cockpit` but **not committed**; no draft PR opened yet.

**Single next step**

- Founder drops the four real icons into `Assets.xcassets` and names them on the roster; then
  commit the icon work and open the draft PR.

## Handoff — 2026-09-25 (real faces + caustic shimmer)

**Completed**

- **Real art landed (T4.3/T4.4 cuts).** `Assets.xcassets` now ships eight imagesets — four
  `Face*Header` (40/80/120px, full detail) and four `Face*MenuBar` (18/36/54px, solid
  silhouette) — all black-ink-on-transparent with `template-rendering-intent: template` and
  `-strip`ped `graya` sources. `IconRoster.all` names them (`headerAsset` / `menuBarAsset`),
  so swapping art is a data change, not a view change.
- **`AppIconMark` reworked.** Both surfaces render `.template` (the header's black-on-clear
  art would be invisible on the near-black canvas otherwise, and the template gets tinted by
  the face's accent). Added a `size` parameter because raster art ignores `.font`; the
  header now frames the mark at `CockpitPopoverView.markSize` (26pt).
- **Header caustic shimmer (T4.5).** New stitchable shader `Shaders/Caustics.metal` (two
  drifting value-noise fields → a highlight gated by the artwork's alpha, so the silhouette
  never moves — only the light does) wrapped by `Views/CausticsEffect.swift`
  (`TimelineView(.animation)` + `.colorEffect`, disabled under **Reduce Motion**). Header-only.
- **Metal toolchain note.** `.metal` files need Xcode's separately-downloadable Metal
  toolchain; on a fresh machine `xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain` first (this
  machine: build version 27A266a, `Status: installed`).
- **Verified:** `xcodegen generate` → `xcodebuild … build` → **BUILD SUCCEEDED**;
  `xcodebuild … test` → **11 tests in 4 suites passing**; `Assets.car` (40 KB) and
  `default.metallib` (69 KB) confirmed inside the bundle.

**Half-finished / open**

- The Icon Composer **`.icns` app icon (T4.4)** is still pending the founder's export — the
  header/menu-bar art is wired, but the bundle app icon has not been replaced.
- The shimmer and the header art have been **eyeballed and approved** by the founder (panel
  looks "fabulous"; colours "exceptional"). The menu-bar silhouette was re-cut: the first pass
  ran a morphology *Close* that rounded the concave notches and made the 8-point star read as a
  cog/sprocket. The cut now uses a hole-fill (`-threshold` → flood-fill border → replace holes)
  with no closing, which keeps the star points sharp. Source art is **8-pointed**, not a 5-arm
  sea star — worth knowing before anyone "fixes" the shape.
- **Multi-harness detection — done (was the "next real gap").** The engine's
  `detect_runtime()` (`src/sea_star/config.py`) used to probe `KNOWN_RUNTIMES` in order and
  **adopt the first that answered**, returning a single `(name, base_url, model)`. So if
  Osaurus (1337) was up it always won and shadowed oMLX/Ollama/LM Studio etc. — which is
  exactly why the panel showed `osaurus · foundation` instead of the model the founder was
  actually loading in oMLX. Now `probe_runtimes()` probes **every** live runtime concurrently
  (`asyncio.gather`, one `PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` budget) and returns a `RuntimeProbe` per live
  responder. `detect_runtime(probes=…)` and `load_config(probes=…)` reuse the survey;
  single-runtime machines are unchanged. The bridge emits `runtimes[]` (optional key;
  `schema_version` stays `1`), and the cockpit's Harness row is a pick-list when more than one
  is live.
- **Port sweep — done (the *real* cause of "Refresh missed my model").** The first-wins bug
  above was only half the story: `KNOWN_RUNTIMES` looks at oMLX on **8000**, but the founder
  runs it on **8009** (confirmed via `lsof` + `~/.omlx/settings.json`), and the same account
  runs a second copy on 8000 — harness ports are simply not fixed. `config.py` now has
  `scan_ports()` (known-harness ports first, then `EXTRA_SCAN_PORTS` like 8009/5000/9000) and
  `probe_runtimes()` sweeps them all, naming each responder by its self-reported `owned_by`
  when specific (`omlx`), else the port's known harness, else `"local"`; generic owners
  (`library`, `user` …) are dropped. `SEASTAR_SCAN_PORTS` overrides the set. Still local-only,
  same timeout. This is **not** a cache/network problem — it never was.
- Start/stop still does not watch the child's exit (state can go stale if `serve` dies).
- Graph embedding (T4.2), re-index (T4.1) and operator docs (T6.x) are untouched.
- Multi-harness + port-sweep work is **committed** on `feat/macapp-cockpit` (two commits) and
  pushed; **draft PR #2** is open at https://github.com/Roqett/Sea-Star/pull/2.

**Single next step**

- Founder's `.icns` export for T4.4 (the app icon is the last unwired piece), or a live
  run-through of the harness picker against 8009 to confirm the sweep names oMLX correctly;
  then fold the port-sweep commit into draft PR #2.
